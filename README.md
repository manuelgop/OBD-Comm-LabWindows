# OBD-Comm-LabWindows
Communication via serial from LabWindows CVI with the OBD interface in a car.
This is a project we developed in class, we used LabWindows CVI from National Instruments to create a nice interface,
then we communicate via serial with the OBD connector in a car, asking for varios sensor values.
